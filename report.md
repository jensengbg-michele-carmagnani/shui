## Features implemented 
```python 


The challenge in this project is the encryption and decryption of sensitive information contained in the database.
The user can create posts to share important information among the other user but this information will be encrypted in the backend. 
This protects them from leaks. 
In case of an emergency, the user can cancel itself from the DB and render all his posts anonymous!
I use just to secure the access to the backend as well the information about the post is encrypted with Crypto-js.
The token has a time-expired of 15 minutes, after that point the user has to login again. (it has not handled yet the refresh token function)
```
